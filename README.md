## About the List

This is a list of articles and books teaching web scraping.

### Base Things

To know base things is more important than to know particular tools or implementations.

It is important to know HTTP, TCP, TLS, DNS, HTML, XML, XPath, CSS, DOM, proxying network requests, etc, etc. You get idea.

It is LESS important to know how to build crawler with SuperScrapingFramework or what function of PowerfulHTMLParsingLibrary allows you to extract text from selected element of HTML DOM tree. These things are very specific. You do not have to know how to operate with every scraping framework or HTML parsing package in the world. If you know base things it just a matter of short time to get knowledge about how to operate base things with a particular programming package.

### Information Availability

I think it does not make sense to include in the list a book which does not presents online. The list must provide information which is accessable instantly.

### Information Granularity

If a book contains a number of topics. It makes sense to refer to particular topic of the book in a particular section of Learning Web Scraping list.

### How to Contribute

You may submit new issue with article or book you want to add. I will read article or take a look at animals on a cover picture of the book and will decide is it worth to add to the list or not.
