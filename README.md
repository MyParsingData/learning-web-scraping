# Learning Web Scraping

I want to build a list of articles and books teaching web scraping.

At the moment I have no clear understand of what exactly articles and books should be in the list.

The base idea of whole thing is what knowledges about base things are more important than knowledges
about particular tools or implementations.

It is very important to know how HTTP and TCP works, what is TLS, what is domain name, how domain name resolving is
happening, what is HTML, XML, XPath, CSS, DOM, what is proxying network request, etc, etc. You get idea. The things that everybody must know.

It is LESS important to know how to build crawler with Scrapy or what function of BeautifulSoup allows you to extract text from element of HTML DOM tree. These things are very specific. You do not have to know how to operate with every scraping or HTML parsing package in the world. If you know base things it just a matter of short time to get knowledge about how to operate base things with particular programming package.
